Collector's Social Network Prototype
This project is an early prototype for a collector's social network developed with Node.js, MySQL, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a platform for collectors to create profiles, log in, add collection items, edit them, and delete them. Additionally, there is a search bar feature to search for collector items.

Features
User Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in securely.
Profile Creation: Collectors can create their profiles with personal details.
Collection Management: Users can add, edit, and delete items in their collection.
Search Functionality: The application includes a search bar to find collector items efficiently.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend server environment.
MySQL: Database management system for storing user and collection data.
HTML5 & CSS: Frontend markup and styling.
JavaScript: Client-side scripting for dynamic behavior.
Responsive Design: Ensures compatibility and usability across various devices and screen sizes.
